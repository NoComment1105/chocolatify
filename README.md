This pack is 1.16.x at it's oldest. I am **NOT** going to back port any of these changes to any other versions
I will try my hardest to updates this pack, in its latest release at the time, on the day of the next version release and will add further features as i get a chance to evaluate the difficulty of the new items

### Compiling / Using this pack
If you choose to download the .zip of this repository, to correctly use this pack you need to do a couple of things
1. You need to separate chocolatify_vx.x from the rest of the .zip
2. Compress chocolatify_vx.x into a .zip file itself
3. Put into your resource packs folder in your Minecraft files/server files and you're ready to use
